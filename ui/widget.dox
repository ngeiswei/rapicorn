/*! @page widgets	Widget System

A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI_widget">GUI Widget</a> is the main element that
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface">Graphical User Interfaces</a> (GUI)
made with Rapicorn are composed of.

@par Widget States
The following is a list of states a widget can be in, a combination of multiple states may apply to a widget at any given time.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::NORMAL - "normal"</b><br/> Ordinary widget state to start with, not activated, insensitive or otherwise special.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::ACCELERATABLE - "acceleratable"</b><br/> Widget flag indicating the available of accelerators or mnemonic shortcuts.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::HOVER - "hover"</b><br/> Widget flag indicating that the mouse is over the widget.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::PANEL - "panel"</b><br/> Widget flag indicating that the widget is rendered as part of a panel section.
- <b>(No state flag) - "focusable"</b>: A widget's ability to accept the input focus.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::DEFAULT - "default"</b><br/> Widget flag that enables widgets to receive the default activation.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::SELECTED - "selected"</b><br/> Widget flag indicating that the widget is currently selected.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::FOCUSED - "focused"</b><br/> Widget flag indicating that the widget is part of the focus chain, i.e. the widget or one of its descendants has the input focus.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::INSENSITIVE - "insensitive"</b><br/> Widget flag that disables input event processing, see pointer_sensitive()
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::ACTIVE - "active"</b><br/> Widget flag used by widgets that can be activated or toggled.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::RETAINED - "retained"</b><br/> Widget flag indicating that its activation state is held back, hidden or inconsistent.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::STASHED - "stashed"</b><br/> Widget flag used to hide child widgets by containers.
<!-- - <b>Rapicorn::WidgetState::STATE* - "state*"</b><br/> Reserved for future uses. -->

Rationales for widget state ordering and matching precedence for rendering purposes:
- In general, functional flags take precedence over style flags.
- <b>"acceleratable"</b>: Just for styling, takes least precedence, as it's usually a secondary indicator, next to a mnemonic displayed.
- <b>"panel" / "hover"</b>: Panel rendering takes precedence, as hovering can be implemented via additional effects.
- <b>"focusable" / "panel"</b>: Navigation information takes precedence over panel section styling.
- <b>"acceleratable" / "default" / "focusable"</b>: Ordering occours according to higher specificity and use frequency.
- <b>"default" / "selected"</b>: Selected states are usually more dynamic / shorter lived, so should probably take precedences.
- <b>"insensitive" / "acceleratable"</b>: Insensitivity takes precedence because it disables navigation or activation abilities.
- <b>"insensitive" / "selected"</b>: Insensitive widgets may be part of selection groups, but stay insensitive.
- <b>"focused" / "selected"</b>: Focus chain indication needs to take precedence to allow focus navigation inside selections.
- <b>"insensitive" / "focused"</b>: Insensitive widgets cannot form part of the focus chain.
- <b>"active" / "focused"</b>: Focus handling cannot toggle activation state, so activation takes precedence.
- <b>"retained" / "active"</b>: The retained state possibly invalidates or ambiguates the activation state, so it takes precedence.

@par Widget Flags
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::anchored()</b><br/> The toplevel parent (root) of an anchored widget is a Rapicorn::Window. The Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::hierarchy_changed() method is called whenever the Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::ANCHORED state of a widget changes.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::visible()</b><br/> A widget is visible if its Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::VISIBLE flag is set.<br/> Use: A widget must be visible to actively participate in size requisition and size allocation. In order to grab focus and process key events, the widget and all its parents must be visible, see Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::key_sensitive().
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::viewable()</b><br/> A widget is viewable if it's visible, its Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::UNVIEWABLE flag is unset and its parent is viewable.<br/> Use: Children may be temporarily taken offscreen in which case they are flagged Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::UNVIEWABLE. Examples are offscreen children of a list, inactive notebook pages or an inactive popup.
- <b>Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::drawable()</b><br/> A widget is drawable if it's viewable and its clipped_allocation has non-zero size. A widget must be drawable to participate in pointer event handling and rendering, see Rapicorn::WidgetImpl::pointer_sensitive().

@par Focus Handling
A Rapicorn.Window allows a specific widget to receive keyboard events at any given time, this is the "focus widget".
Keyboard shortcuts like Tab, Shift-Tab, Up, Down, Left, Right (sometimes in combination with Control) allow moving the focus from one widget to another.
-# The Rapicorn.WidgetImpl.move_focus() method generally implements movement of the current focus widget along the list of focusable widgets in a window.
-# Rapicorn.Container generally keep track of the last child that had focus (the focus_child) or was part of the focus chain (an ancestor of the widget having focus).
-# Onece focus moves on, the Container.focus_child is adjusted or unset. Some containers need to memorize the last focus child, the Container.focus_lost() method can be overridden for this purpose.
-# The Window.auto_focus property controls whether a window contains an initially focused widget when it is shown.
-# The FOCUS_CHAIN flag is used to keep track of the current focus widget and its ancestry.
